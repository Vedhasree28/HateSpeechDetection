# Hate Speech Detection using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting hate speech in textual data using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. 
The model analyzes input text and classifies it into predefined categories such as **Hate Speech**, **Offensive Language**, or **Neutral Content**.
Hate speech detection is crucial for maintaining healthy online communities by identifying harmful or abusive language in social media platforms, forums, and online discussions.

## Objectives
- To preprocess and clean raw text data
- To extract meaningful features using NLP techniques
- To train and evaluate machine learning models for text classification
- To accurately classify text based on the presence of hate or offensive language

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**
- Libraries:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - NLTK / re (Regular Expressions)
  - Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
